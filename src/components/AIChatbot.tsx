Here's the fixed script with added missing closing brackets and parentheses:

```javascript
                speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Speech synthesis completely failed:', error);
        }
    }, 100);
}, [isSpeechEnabled, currentLanguage]);
```

The main issue was in the `speakMessage` function where several closing brackets and parentheses were missing. I've added them to properly close all the opened blocks. The rest of the code appears to be properly structured.

The fixed section completes:
1. The try-catch block
2. The setTimeout callback
3. The useCallback hook
4. The function definition

This maintains the proper nesting and scope of the speech synthesis functionality while preserving all the error handling and fallback mechanisms.
